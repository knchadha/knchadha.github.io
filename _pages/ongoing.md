* **Auditing Private Prediction** <br>
Developed novel techniques to audit the Renyi DP satisfied by a mechanism. Used the framework to elicit empirical privacy guarantees for a variety of private prediction algorithms like PATE, CaPC, PromptPATE and Private kNN across varying levels of adversary access and observation models.

* **Better White-Box Membership Inference Attacks** <br>
Working on developing better membership inference attacks with white-box access to mechanism outputs.
