I am Research Scientist in the Central Applied Science team at Meta.
I am interested in answering questions in differential privacy, trustworthy AI, uncertainty quantification, and federated learning.

Previously, I was a PhD student at Stanford University, advised by [Prof. John Duchi](https://web.stanford.edu/~jduchi/). Before joining Stanford, I did my undergraduate studies at IIT Bombay where I worked with [Prof. Vivek Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/borkar), [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/) and [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/) on Game Theory, Power Systems and Bandit Algorithms.
