I am a fifth year PhD student at Stanford University, advised by [Prof. John Duchi](https://web.stanford.edu/~jduchi/). I am interested in answering questions in differential privacy, trustworthy AI, uncertainty quantification, and federated learning, for which I use theoretical tools from statistics and optimization, complemented by rigorous experimentation.

During my PhD, I have been fortunate to have transformative internship experiences at _Apple AI/ML_ (Summer 22) and _Google Deepmind_ (Summer 23). Before joining Stanford, I did my undergraduate studies at IIT Bombay where I worked with [Prof. Vivek Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/borkar), [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/) and [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/) on Game Theory, Power Systems and Bandit Algorithms.
